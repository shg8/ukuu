--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

deb packages:

Install pbuilder-dist:
  sudo apt install pbuilder-dist

To create the deb build environment, run one time only.
  make deb_env_create

To update the build environment, run as needed.
  make deb_env_update

To (re)build a deb without incrementing build number or doing make clean.
  make deb

To build a deb for release. Increments build number and does clean before build.
  make release_deb

For any of the deb-related build targets, you may also build for some other target
distribution by adding "dist=<dist>" and/or "arch=<arch>" to the end of the command.

So, to build a deb for xenial (if you're not running xenial),
first, one-time setup
  make deb_env_create dist=xenial
then
  make deb dist=xenial

Install the currently built deb
Allows to install built deb without having to know it's long path & filename
Already includes sudo, don't need "sudo make install-deb"
  make install-deb

Uninstall any version of deb package that might be installed
Allows to test "make install" without conflict or ambiguity with installed deb
Already includes sudo, don't need "sudo make uninstall-deb"
  make uninstall-deb

debian/changelog is maintained automatically (that is, "dch" is called when
needed, you still have to manually edit once dch launches the editor), but you
can also update it manually any time.
This will run "dch" with appropriate commandline options to pre-load the pkg
name, version number, maintainer name, maintainer email etc.
  make changelog
